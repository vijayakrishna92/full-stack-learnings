##  Story

I was born on June 10, 1992, in Kerala, into a joint Brahmin family passionate about Yakshagana (Karnataka’s folk art). My uncle and cousin are still active performers.

As a child, I was quiet, shy, and often daydreamed in class. After 10th (scored 456 marks), I chose electronics in PU mainly because my cousin did, and because "glowing bulbs" sounded interesting. Back then, my only goal was "engineers get good jobs" — I didn’t even know how to explore other streams.

During my B.Sc, I first discovered coding: machine-level, assembly, and later C. I graduated with 64.74%.  
In my master’s, I learned VLSI, Verilog, VHDL, and Arduino, mentored by a professor who loved math and experimentation. I also learned MATLAB and graduated with 63.36%.

After graduation, I struggled: BPOs rejected me for slow typing & poor English; software companies didn't consider my MSc in electronics as "CS enough". Returning home, I worked at Tecprosoft building student hardware projects, coding Arduino, and training students — but left due to low pay & long hours.

Later, I joined a bread factory as a machine operator & trainer, where family health issues and the pandemic kept me until 2023. I briefly tried coding again in 2022, but only in mid-2023 did I fully commit to learning Python.

Through my cousin, I joined Omdena as a volunteer: initially observing, collecting data, writing reports, running basic code. Later, I contributed to RAG chatbots, benchmarking AI agents, and remote sensing projects — collaborating globally.

I joined OptimumAI as a volunteer too: writing blogs, designing brochures, teaching ML & GenAI topics. Along the way, I built portfolio sites, Flutter apps, and integrated AI backends.

From someone who once only *watched* others code, I became someone who codes, teaches, and builds.
