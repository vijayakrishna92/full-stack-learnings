📜 STORY
I was born on June 10, 1992, in Kerala, southern India, into a joint Brahmin family speaking Kannada and passionate about Yakshagana, the folk dance of Karnataka. My uncle and cousin still perform as artists.  

As a child, I was quiet, shy, and often daydreamed during classes. After 10th grade (scored 456), I joined PU with electronics simply because it meant "glowing bulbs" and my cousin chose it—my mindset then was that engineers earned high salaries. I didn’t know how to fill forms or explore other streams. In my degree, I first saw coding: machine-level, assembly, and later C. I graduated with 64.74%.

During my master's, I explored VLSI, Verilog, VHDL, and Arduino, encouraged by a professor who loved experimenting with math in code. I also learned MATLAB and graduated with 63.36%.

In the job market, I faced rejection—BPOs turned me down for slow typing & poor English; software companies rejected my MSc electronics background. Returning home, I found work at Tecprosoft as a hardware engineer building student projects, coding for Arduino, and training students. After a year, I left due to low pay and long hours.

I then joined a bread factory as a machine operator & trainer. Family health issues and the pandemic kept me there until 2023, with a brief coding attempt in 2022. Mid-2023, I fully restarted learning Python. Through my cousin, I joined Omdena and began volunteering: initially observing, collecting data, writing reports, and running simple code.

I later joined OptimumAI as a volunteer: designing brochures and certificates, writing blogs, and teaching ML & GenAI topics. At Omdena, I actively contributed to RAG chatbots, benchmarking AI agents, and remote sensing projects, collaborating with global experts. I also built portfolio websites, Flutter apps, and integrated AI backends.

From someone who once only watched others code, I became someone who codes, teaches, and builds.
